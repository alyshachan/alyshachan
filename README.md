## About Me
Hello! My name's Alysha and I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah. Throughout my academic journey, my interests within computing are software engineering, human-centered interaction, and full-stack development. I am passionate about creating user-focused technologies to benefit human experiences.

I have interned at Pluralsight as part of their frontend development team, built a [social media to-do list app](https://github.com/alyshachan/can-did) as part of the Dandilyonn SEEDS Internship Program, developed a custom webpage for a [PAC 12+3 Dean's Summit](https://deansummit.utah.edu/), and collaborated in a team of four for our [capstone project](https://github.com/alyshachan/JobPreppers) aimed to help users prepare their job hunting process.

Outside of tech, I love being creative. From painting, graphic design, and making 3D figurines, I do it all. Whether I’m building apps or bringing ideas to life through art, I enjoy blending logic and creativity in everything I do, with the hopes to create something meaningful to the public they can resonate with.
